Assignment 1

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods in development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Importance of Software Engineering: Building and maintaining complex systems, driving innovation and productivity, Enhancing user experience, Enhancing security and reliability, Enabling scalability and reliability, Enabling cloud computing, empowering AI and data science.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 
The invention of the high-level programming languages(1950s):Initially, programmers used Assembly language for programming which was difficult to read, write and debug. The high-level programming languagesmade it possible to write code that was more abstract and easier to understand, which led significant increase of software engineers
The development of the software development process (1960s): In the early days of software development, there was no formal process for developing software. This often led to software that was unreliable, buggy, and difficult to maintain. In the 1960s, software engineers began to develop formal software development processes, such as the waterfall model and the agile development model. These processes helped to improve the quality and reliability of software.
The rise of object-oriented programming (1980s): Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that allows software engineers to organize code into objects. This makes it easier to write code that is modular, reusable, and extensible. OOP has become the dominant programming paradigm for developing large-scale software applications.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
SDLC involves three phases: Requirements (Accessing the needs), Design (Coming up with high-level and detailed architecture), Implementation/Execution (Coding and building up the software), Testing (Incorporating different testing techniques to meet quality standards), Deployment (Releasing the software to the market) and Maintenance (Ongoing support).

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
