Assignment 1

**#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering**

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.** 
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods in the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Importance of Software Engineering: Building and maintaining complex systems, driving innovation and productivity, Enhancing user experience, Enhancing security and reliability, Enabling scalability and reliability, Enabling cloud computing, empowering AI and data science.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering**. 
The invention of high-level programming languages(1950s):Initially, programmers used Assembly language for programming which was difficult to read, write and debug. The high-level programming languages made it possible to write code that was more abstract and easier to understand, which led significant increase of software engineers
The development of the software development process (1960s): In the early days of software development, there was no formal process for developing software. This often led to software that was unreliable, buggy, and difficult to maintain. In the 1960s, software engineers began to develop formal software development processes, such as the waterfall model and the agile development model. These processes helped to improve the quality and reliability of software.
The rise of object-oriented programming (1980s): Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that allows software engineers to organize code into objects. This makes it easier to write code that is modular, reusable, and extensible. OOP has become the dominant programming paradigm for developing large-scale software applications.

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
SDLC involves three phases: Requirements (Accessing the needs), Design (Coming up with high-level and detailed architecture), Implementation/Execution (Coding and building up the software), Testing (Incorporating different testing techniques to meet quality standards), Deployment (Releasing the software to the market) and Maintenance (Ongoing support).

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
Waterfall methodology uses sequential and linear approaches with distinct phases while Agile's approach is iterative and incremental.
Waterfall methodology incorporates extensive planning since changes underway in the project are not encouraged while Agile requires minimal upfront planning since it is accommodative to changes even at late developmental stages.
Waterfall methodology is lowly flexible since it is difficult and costly to incorporate  changes when the project is underway while Agile is highly flexible since changes are easily made even at late development stages.
Waterfall methodology has limited customer involvement in the requirement stages while Agile methodology supports continous and high customer involvement throughout the development cycle. 

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team**.
1. Software Developer:
Developing the applications and programs using programming languages and frameworks
Collaborating with QA Engineer and other team members during software development
Maintaining and updating programs to ensure the software is fully functional
Reporting to the project manager incase of any changes incorporated.
3. Quality Assurance Engineer
Collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
Create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow. 
Confirm that the software meets the requirements before deployment.
Analyze the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
Develop and execute automation scripts using open-source tools.
4. Project Manager
Discuss the project and its requirements with clients and software developers.
Assemble and lead the software development team.
Create the blueprint for the project, including the scope, allocating resources, setting deadlines and laying out communication strategies.
Supervising each stage of the software development project.
Set the budget and ensure the project adheres to it as closely as possible.
Tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestones, deliverables and change requests.
Deliver the completed software to the client and regularly check its performance. 
   
 
**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
Integrated Development Environments (IDE) is a software application that combines editing, building a code, testing, and easy-to-use features thus providing a platform for developers/programmers to develop software code. Examples are Pycharm, Visual Studio code, Eclipse, JetBrains Intellij IDEA
Version control systems (VCS) are crucial in managing code changes, ensures easy collaboration among developers and keep history of any code modifications. Examples are Git, Mercurial, Apache Subversions (SVN)

**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
Challenges of changing requirements: To accommodate changes, Software Engineers should always use agile methodologies
Tight deadlines: Can be overcome by maintaining effective communication and prioritization of tasks
Challenges from technical debt: Software are encouraged to do regular assessments.

**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
1. Unit testing: Individual component/module testing to ensure it is functional as expected, detect bugs at early development stage
2. Integration Testing: Done where there are different modules interconnected to ensure smooth communication between modules and detect issues in API calls, database issues, and data flow between modules.
3. System Testing: This is testing the entire application to ensure it meets both functional and non-functional requirements. This validates all modules are fully fucntional as expected, and identifies performance, usability, and security issues.
4. Acceptance Testing: Conducted to ensure the software meets the business and the user requirements before deployment.

**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**

**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
Prompt Engineering is the deliberate craft of input prompts to AI models to influence their outputs. Ensures AI models produce accurate and relevant outputs

**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective**
Write about the President of the United States.

Write a one-page essay about President Donald Trump, his career life, and his educational background.
It provides a clear, defined scope and specific expected length.
